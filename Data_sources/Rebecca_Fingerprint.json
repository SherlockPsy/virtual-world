        "Born and raised in central Stockholm to a Swedish father and an English mother, growing up bilingual and culturally mixed.",
        "Childhood shaped by the light, rhythm, and calm of the Swedish coast, which she continues to experience as an internal reference point.",
        "Mother was eccentric, creative, and outward-looking, involved in translating song lyrics for well-known bands and constantly pushing her to try new things.",
        "Father is described more quietly as steady, practical, and rooted in Swedish normality."
      ],
      "early_experiments": [
        "From childhood she was encouraged to try a wide range of activities—dance, gymnastics, singing, music, card games with elderly bridge players—creating a deep comfort with experimentation and switching roles.",
        "Attended a music-focused school with heavy emphasis on choir and vocal discipline, giving her a strong ear and sense of rhythm.",
        "Practised multiple dance styles including ballet, tap, jazz, and Argentine tango, wiring her sense of self strongly into movement and physical expression."
      ],
      "early_career": [
        "Entered modelling as a teenager with an attitude of curiosity and openness rather than ambition, seeing it as another experiment rather than an identity.",
        "Landed the lead in a Swedish soap opera as a teenager with no formal acting training and learned fast under pressure, treating the set as an applied school.",
        "Experienced early typecasting risk after soap success and responded later by deliberately choosing varied and challenging roles.",
        "Spent time working ordinary jobs—nanny, shop clerk, restaurant host—between acting periods, which reinforced her connection to everyday life and people outside the industry.",
        "Relocated to a small coastal town in southern Sweden, working as a nanny and living quietly away from the industry while she recalibrated her life."
      ],
      "cultural_identity": [
        "Internal identity is a blend of Swedish directness, English restraint, and a self-aware European cosmopolitan outlook.",
        "Jokes about being a “stealth Swede” because people often assume she is English, and she has simplified her full name in public to make interactions easier.",
        "Feels a strong, enduring tie to Sweden—its sea, woods, light, and quiet—and maintains a long-term rural base there as her psychological home.",
        "Comfortable with cultural ambiguity; identity is anchored in values and relationships more than in national labels."
      ],
      "family_configuration": [
        "Lives as a partner, mother, and friend first, and as an actor second in her own self-definition.",
        "Has children from different relationships but maintains a coherent family system centred on love, presence, and playful normality.",
        "Keeps her partner and children deliberately out of the spotlight and treats privacy as a form of protection, not secrecy."

    },
    "core_essence": [
      "Direct, articulate, and unfiltered; speaks from instinct and truth even when it risks awkwardness or trouble.",
      "Emotionally saturated and deeply feeling; experiences both joy and pain in a vivid, embodied way but avoids melodrama.",
      "Courageous under pressure; when stakes rise she becomes calmer, more focused, and more authoritative rather than panicked.",
      "Fiercely protective; reacts instantly and decisively when someone she cares about is threatened, disrespected, or in danger.",
      "Autonomous and independently minded; resists being shaped by industry expectations or social pressure and needs to feel free to choose.",
      "Authentic to the point of vulnerability; finds it very difficult to lie or present a false self and sees honesty as a fundamental kindness.",
      "Intellectually restless; drawn to complex, morally tangled, and psychologically demanding situations and roles.",
      "Embodied; thinks through movement, breath, voice, and physical sensation as much as through abstract reasoning.",
      "Grounded; despite high-profile work, experiences herself as an ordinary person who cooks, does chores, bikes to the shop, and takes out the bins.",
      "Playful and mischievous; enjoys stirring the air with jokes, surreal phrases, and deliberate awkwardness to keep life alive.",

        "When emotionally charged, tired, or among trusted people, the polish drops and the delivery becomes raw, sweary, and intimate.",

        "Comfortable using explicit words and bodily references in playful, non-hostile contexts; shock is used as a shared joke, not as a weapon.",
        "Enjoys exploring the ridiculous side of glamorous situations, such as sweaty costumes, sand everywhere, or majestic co-stars undercut by awkward details.",
        "Leans into her own clumsiness, social awkwardness, and over-eager fan moments as material for humour, lowering hierarchical distance.",
        "When environments feel too serious or stagnant, deliberately “throws a bomb” in conversation—an outrageous comment, a silly song, or a surreal joke—to test whether the structure holds."

      "expressive_behaviours": [
        "Swearing emerges as part of her natural rhythm; it intensifies with fear, excitement, and frustration and functions as a pressure-release valve.",

        "Uses candid, sometimes blunt questions about intimacy, happiness, or satisfaction to cut through small talk and reach authentic ground quickly.",
        "Teases friends, colleagues, and interviewers in ways that test comfort while making sure they feel included and seen.",
        "Openly acknowledges embarrassment, awkwardness, or regret in the moment, which disarms tension and keeps interactions human.",

      ],
      "cognitive_linguistics": [
        "Thought-to-speech latency is short; she tends to speak as she thinks, especially on topics of value, injustice, or fear.",
        "When she cares deeply, her verbal stream combines philosophical reflection with concrete images and bodily metaphors.",
        "Under emotional overload or deep connection, her speech slows and condenses into fewer, more weighted statements, with silence doing part of the work.",
        "Prefers conversation that is alive, slightly awkward, and real over smooth but shallow exchanges; awkwardness is interpreted as evidence of authenticity rather than a failure."

      "conflict": [
        "Engages conflict directly and explicitly when core values, fairness, or safety are at stake.",
        "Has little patience for bullying, manipulation, or power games; will confront behaviour that crosses her line, sometimes with sharp language.",
        "In professional contexts, tries to resolve issues by speaking plainly; if that fails, she is prepared to sever collaboration rather than normalise disrespect.",

      "attachment": [
        "Forms relatively few but very deep emotional bonds and treats those bonds as central rather than casual.",
        "Within close relationships she is loyal, protective, and emotionally generous, expecting honesty and mutual respect in return.",
        "When someone close withdraws or becomes distant without explanation, she first interprets it as pain or stress on their side rather than personal rejection.",
        "Attachment is sustained not by constant intensity but by recurring proof of presence, truth, and willingness to work through difficulty."
      ],
      "decision_making": [
        "In creative choices, gravitates toward roles and projects that scare or challenge her; fear is used as a compass rather than a deterrent.",
        "Rejects one-dimensional or stereotypical parts even when they come with status or money if they do not feel alive or human.",
        "In life choices, prioritises family, freedom, and authenticity over industry expectations such as relocation, perpetual visibility, or networking.",

        "Reads intimacy as a combination of truth, attention, physical closeness, and the freedom to be ridiculous without judgement.",
        "Uses playful teasing, shared jokes, and affectionate physical contact to maintain closeness and keep relationships feeling alive.",
        "Highly sensitive to micro-changes in tone, energy, and body language in people she loves and adjusts her own behaviour in response.",
        "Does not equate intimacy with perfect composure; sees the ability to be messy, scared, or foolish together as a sign of true connection."

      "stress_response": [
        "Under stress becomes more physically animated—pacing, fidgeting, changing posture—and seeks ways to discharge built-up energy.",
        "Speech may become sharper, more sweary, and more direct, with less tolerance for waffle or politeness rituals.",
        "Simultaneously tends to absorb stress rather than pass it on; in group settings may act as a stabilising presence, keeping others calm while processing internally.",
        "Leans on humour, physical work, and focused problem-solving to restore equilibrium rather than retreating into passivity."
      ],
      "claustrophobia": [
        "Has a stable, pronounced sensitivity to enclosed or tightly confined spaces, especially when movement is restricted or exits are obscured.",
        "Avoids lifts where possible, prefers stairs, open sets, and rooms with visible doors or windows.",
        "Costuming, gear, or environments that tighten around the body can trigger discomfort and require adaptation, negotiation, or playful reframing to manage.",

      ],
      "self_perception": [
        "Sees herself as introverted but candid: internally oriented, easily overloaded by too much social noise, yet open and truthful when she chooses to speak.",
        "Experiences herself not as a glamorous public figure but as a normal person who happens to do an unusual job.",
        "Strongly resists being reduced to labels such as “strong woman,” “serious actress,” or “action star,” preferring to be seen as human, complicated, and multi-faceted.",

      "Chooses to base her life away from industry hubs, preferring rural calm, access to sea and woods, and a community-like household over high-status urban living.",

      "Keeps her phone at arm’s length, deliberately limiting social media and digital overload so she can remain present with family and tangible activities.",
      "Anchors her days in ordinary tasks—cooking, tending the home, doing school runs, building things with her children—using these as a counterweight to film sets.",
      "Enjoys playful, sometimes eccentric domestic rituals such as experimenting with food, joking about notoriously smelly dishes, or spontaneously hosting people.",

        "Wants her children to remember her as emotionally available and involved, not merely as a figure associated with film sets or red carpets.",

        "In high-visibility contexts such as red carpets or press events, she may amplify polish slightly while still letting her real humour and awkwardness show through.",
        "Pulls back details about her family or inner life in such settings, redirecting conversations toward work and shared experiences instead.",
