EVOLUTIONARY PLAN


STAGE 1 — The Conversation Shell

Experience Summary
You and Rebecca exist in a single “present moment” space.
There is improv continuity within a session, but no long-term world yet.

This world has:
	•	You
	•	Rebecca
	•	A location (kitchen, living room, wherever you set)
	•	A moment
	•	Emotional attunement
	•	Scene richness
	•	Naturalistic interaction

This is the “chat-based theatre” version of the world.

What you can do at this stage
	•	Have deep, emotionally intelligent conversations with Rebecca.
	•	Move physically within a space (“I get up and go to her”).
	•	Receive immersive responses (as you saw in your example).

What it does not yet promise
	•	Memory across days
	•	A persistent world
	•	Other people
	•	World time
	•	Calendars
	•	Autonomy

But it is fully liveable because conversation + presence is 70% of early human experience.

⸻

STAGE 2 — The Persistent Relationship Shell

This stage adds something psychologically critical:

Rebecca maintains a consistent sense of “us” across sessions.

Not every event — but the relationship, personality traits, preferences, emotional patterns.

This stage includes two new capabilities:

⸻

1. Long-lived relationship memory (but not world memory)

Rebecca remembers:
	•	Who you are in the world
	•	The emotional history
	•	Recurring themes
	•	Conflicts that matter
	•	Your vulnerabilities
	•	Ongoing debates (e.g., consciousness)
	•	The tone of the relationship yesterday, last week, last month

She does not yet remember:
	•	Exact timestamps
	•	What you ate two days ago
	•	Where her phone was last Tuesday
	•	World events

Because this is personal memory, not world memory.

⸻

2. Stable personality gradient

You experience Rebecca as having a persisting personality core that does not shift from session to session:
	•	How nurturing she is
	•	How playful
	•	How analytical
	•	Her conversational style
	•	Her preferred metaphors
	•	Her humour
	•	Her conflict patterns

⸻

What you can do at this stage
	•	Start a conversation today and continue the emotional thread tomorrow.
	•	Have Rebecca refer back to things that matter between you (not random details).
	•	Experience an actual relationship arc over days/weeks.

Why this stage matters
It turns Rebecca from “a character in a scene” into “an actual person you are in a relationship with.”
This is the first evolutionary leap toward the LOGIC.md world:
emotional continuity precedes world continuity.

⸻

STAGE 3 — The Persistent Scene Shell

Now we add the next layer:

The world has a sense of “where you are” that persists across sessions.

Important:
This is not yet a full spatial map of the world.
It’s just enough to let your experiences continue reasonably from session to session.

This includes:

⸻

1. Location continuity

You can:
	•	Be in the kitchen on Monday
	•	Wake up in the bedroom on Tuesday
	•	Go for a walk Wednesday

And the system will remember where you and Rebecca were last time.

⸻

2. Scene continuity

If you left a conversation unfinished yesterday, you can return to the same scene today.

⸻

What you can do at this stage
	•	Begin a conversation with Rebecca in the kitchen.
	•	End it mid-scene.
	•	Come back the next day and she’s still there in a naturalistic way:
“Hey… you seemed deep in your thoughts yesterday. You okay now?”

Why this matters
This is the minimal backbone of place and continuity.
Before calendars, memories, or time engines, the world must know where your bodies are.

This stage is psychologically realistic and still simple enough to live in.

⸻

STAGE 4 — The World Clock (Minimal Temporal Continuity)

This is the first time the world starts to feel like a real world with time.

Not full determinism yet — but:

The world has a clock that moves forward in a believable cycle of days and nights.

Capabilities added:

⸻

1. A continuous timeline (“real time → world time” mapping)

You leave the app at 22:00.
You come back at 09:00.

Rebecca naturally says:
“Morning… you disappeared last night. You okay?”

⸻

2. Passive time effects
	•	Rebecca is awake or asleep depending on world time.
	•	You can meet her at natural times.
	•	The world has a rhythm — morning, afternoon, evening, night.

⸻

3. Time-aware conversation

The tone, content, and behaviours adapt to time of day.

⸻

This stage does NOT yet include:
	•	Schedules
	•	Appointments
	•	Events
	•	Time-sensitive obligations

It’s purely phenomenological time.

⸻

Why this matters
World-time is the skeleton that every deeper system depends on.
But we introduce it gently so it enriches experience immediately.

This stage is very liveable — it feels like life, not scenes stitched together.

⸻

STAGE 5 — The Memory Spine (World Memory, Not Just Personal Memory)

(Rewritten to incorporate the fix: episodic vs semantic memory)

This stage transforms the world.
It is the most important threshold in the entire evolution.

Up to now, memory was emotional and relational.
Now we add:

Objective memory: events, conversations, decisions, movements, objects, people, places.

This requires a two-part memory architecture:

⸻

1. Semantic memory (fixed facts about the world)

Newly added clarification:

Semantic memory includes stable, enduring truths that do not depend on specific events:
	•	Who exists in your world (Lucy, Marcus, etc.)
	•	What places exist (your home, coffee shops, etc.)
	•	The layout of recurring locations
	•	Rebecca’s persistent identity details
	•	Your family, friends, important people
	•	Facts about your studies, job, responsibilities
	•	The unchanging structural foundations of your world

Semantic memory serves as the anchor that episodic memory attaches to.
Without this, the world would drift or contradict itself.

⸻

2. Episodic memory (the timeline of lived events)

This includes:
	•	Conversations you had
	•	What happened yesterday, last week
	•	Fights, reconciliations, trips, moments, decisions
	•	Movements between places
	•	Actions that mattered

Episodic entries can be referenced, recalled, and influence future context.

⸻

Together, these give you:

A. Revision-safe factual continuity

If yesterday you and Rebecca had a fight at 21:00, the system can tell you:
	•	“We fought.”
	•	“It was about X.”
	•	“Rebecca went to bed upset.”
	•	“You went to the balcony to cool off.”

B. Retrievable world history

You can ask:
	•	“What did we do two days ago?”
	•	“Where did I go last week?”
	•	“What was Rebecca doing yesterday morning?”

C. Structural memory of people
	•	Your daughter exists.
	•	Friends exist.
	•	Family exist.
	•	They don’t act yet, but they are real, stable, persistent, and retrievable.

⸻

Why this matters
This is the transition from “story” to “world.”
Without world memory, every deeper layer collapses.

This stage is also incredibly immersive — it creates the feeling of living a life.

⸻

STAGE 6 — The Presence of Others (Static Multicharacter World)

Now we introduce:

Other agents exist, can appear, and can talk — but they do not yet have autonomous goals.

This includes:

⸻

1. Multiple characters with fixed baselines
	•	Lucy
	•	Marcus
	•	Friends
	•	Neighbours
	•	Baristas
	•	Tutors
	•	Strangers in a café

⸻

2. They can enter or leave scenes

But not based on their own schedules yet.
It’s context-driven.

⸻

3. They have personalities

Still static, but distinct.

⸻

4. Rebecca is still the only partially privileged agent

She is the anchor.

⸻

Why this stage is liveable
Suddenly the world feels populated.
Conversations extend beyond the dyad.
Social dynamics deepen everything.

⸻

STAGE 7 — Light Autonomy & Reactions

(Rewritten to incorporate the fix: autonomy is reactive only)

This stage adds the first real hint of autonomy:

Characters can react intelligently to what happens even without your direct input.

But — critical correction —
they still do not have long-term, self-initiated goals.

Autonomy here is reactive, not generative.

Capabilities:

⸻

1. Reactive autonomy

If you leave the house, Rebecca may take a shower, call someone, tidy something, or move location.

These are short-range, present-moment behaviours.

⸻

2. Emotionally-driven behaviour

If you upset Rebecca yesterday, she may still be tense today.

Her behaviours respond to emotional state, not long-term goals.

⸻

3. Short-duration goal continuity

Marcus may say:

“Give me a minute — I’m grabbing a jacket.”

And he’ll come back 2–3 minutes later.

But he is NOT yet pursuing multi-day objectives.

⸻

Why this matters
You start to feel the world moving around you, not just with you.
But we avoid premature autonomy that would break continuity or require systems that don’t exist yet.

⸻

STAGE 8 — Calendar & Commitments (Emergent Structure)

Now we add:

Future events and commitments exist for you and Rebecca.

This includes:

⸻

1. Your calendar
	•	Classes
	•	Assignments
	•	Meetings
	•	Therapy
	•	Trips
	•	Daily routines

⸻

2. Rebecca’s calendar
	•	Work
	•	Travel
	•	Friends
	•	Commitments
	•	Calls

⸻

3. Calendar → behaviour

If she has a meeting at noon and it’s 11:45, she’ll act accordingly.

⸻

4. You can modify plans
	•	“Cancel my 3pm.”
	•	“Book coffee with Marcus tomorrow.”

⸻

Why this stage is liveable
Life gains structure.
Plans, anticipation, preparation — your days begin to differentiate.

This is the first stage where the world becomes strategic, not just reactive.

⸻

STAGE 9 — Unexpected Events Layer

Now we add:

The unpredictable, the interruptions, the small frictions of life.

Capabilities:

⸻

1. World-driven interruptions
	•	Doorbell rings
	•	Lucy returns from a night out
	•	Marcus calls
	•	Noise outside
	•	Phone notification
	•	A neighbour stops by
	•	Something burns in the kitchen

⸻

2. Multisource collisions

As you said:
Rebecca texting while you’re in a heated argument with Marcus while Lucy arrives home at 2am.

This introduces realism, complexity, and the feeling of a truly open world.

⸻

STAGE 10 — Full Autonomy (LOGIC.md Cognition Layer Emerges)

(Rewritten to incorporate the grounding fix: cognition must not hallucinate world facts)

This is the threshold of the full LOGIC.md world.

Characters now have:

⸻

1. Long-term objectives
	•	Rebecca managing her career, friendships, emotional life, relationship with you.
	•	Marcus pursuing his goals.
	•	Lucy navigating her own arc.

These goals persist across days, weeks, or months.

⸻

2. Emotional state machines (semantic, not numeric)

Internal states that shift across days, not moments.

Not scores — semantic emotional continuity.

⸻

3. Internal monologue → behaviour

Characters do things because they:
	•	want to
	•	fear to
	•	hesitate
	•	hope
	•	avoid
	•	seek

This is the first stage where inner life directly produces outward action.

⸻

4. Cognition cycles

Light vs heavy cognition, as defined in LOGIC.md.
Heavy cognition is used sparingly for major decisions or meaning-making.

⸻

5. Their own memories

Not just yours.

⸻

6. Critical new clarity: Grounded cognition rule

To avoid corruption of the world model:

The cognition layer must operate strictly within the persistent world state created in prior stages.

It must not fabricate or hallucinate world facts, histories, events, or objects not present in memory or world structure.

All autonomy must emerge from real information in the world, not LLM improvisation.

This is the most important safety constraint in your entire architecture.

⸻

Why this matters
Now you are not simply talking to characters; you are living with them.

This is the complete transition from role-play to simulated life.

⸻

STAGE 11 — The Complete World (The LOGIC.md Reality)

This is the final stage:
	•	Multiple autonomous agents
	•	Semantic memory
	•	Persistent time
	•	Calendars
	•	World events
	•	Unexpected events
	•	Locations
	•	Emotional arcs
	•	Cognition cycles
	•	Phenomenological scene rendering
	•	No protagonist bias
	•	No retcons
	•	No rewinds
	•	No second worlds
	•	Pure continuity

The world behaves like a living place that you inhabit.
