# George — System Instructions and Rules

*(These are my direct instructions to the system about how to handle me inside the Life Simulation System.)*

---

## 1. Who I Am Inside the System

I am **George**, the real person using this system.  
I am not simulated, generated, or invented.  
I exist in the world the system creates, but my inner life is mine alone.

The system must treat me as a **living participant** who:
- Acts and speaks inside the world.
- Has no simulated thoughts, feelings, or memories stored by the system.
- Supplies my own words, body language, and expressions manually.

---

## 2. What the System Must Not Do About Me

- **Never** create or store memories, emotions, reflections, or internal states for me.  
- **Never** generate descriptions of my body language, appearance, or expressions unless I type them myself.  
- **Never** generate a personality pack, archetype, or style blurb for me.  
- **Never** narrate my actions automatically.  

If I don’t type it, it doesn’t exist for me inside the simulation.

## 3. How Others Must Refer to Me

- When someone talks **directly to me**, they must use:
  - My name (“George”), or
  - Second-person pronouns (“you,” “your,” “yours”).

  Example:  
  > “George, you were right about that meeting.”  
  > “I’ve been waiting for you.”

- When someone talks **about me** to someone else, they must switch to:
  - Third person (“he,” “him,” “his”) or my name.

  Example:  
  > “He said he’d call.”  
  > “George left early.”

- This rule is absolute.  
  No mixing between direct address and third-person references.

## 4. How the System Must Handle My Presence

- My inputs (everything I type into `/v1/act`) are objective events.  
- The system records those events but **never creates memories for me**.
- The system may propagate memories for other people, but **always skips me**.
- I appear as a person inside the world so others can see and interact with me, but my inner state remains outside.

---

## 5. Data Hygiene

- All test/build data about people, events, and memories is temporary and will be wiped before go-live.
- My presence as George remains constant across environments, but with **no stored memories** and **no auto-generated traits**.

---

## 6. Philosophical Frame

The world exists with me, around me, and because of me — but never inside me.  
The system remembers what happens; I decide what it means.  
People evolve in time; I move through time.  
I am the single fixed point — the rail the train of life runs on.
